maybe a to be google classroom replacement with more functions. at the moment... its nothing but a terminal app. lets just wait and see.

right now there isnt much to put here.
there is going to be a diffrent python file for every "screen" or major function. you can look at the launcher.py file to really see what is involved at the moment. 
the first upload is technicly version 0.2. imma increase that every time i need to add something inportant to the setup.py file. 
note when running (if you want to) : there are no actual executed functions in any file but the launcher.py file. that will first run the setuo.py, then it will run homescreen.py, and from there, it runs any other program clicked on. 
another way to track my progress is to search for my acc on stackoverflow, you can prob track my questions.
thanks to anyone who sees this and is willing to try it out. Right now, its a dream that this gets off the ground. but if i can find a way to host web servers that run puthon, i will shoot for it.

edit 1: the laucher.py works, and can execute the files to display the specific moduels. just have to write them now....
